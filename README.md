![suno-api banner](https://github.com/gcui-art/suno-api/blob/main/public/suno-banner.png)

## Introduction

Suno is an amazing AI music service. Although the official API is not yet available, we couldn't wait to integrate its capabilities somewhere.

We discovered that some users have similar needs, so we decided to open-source this project, hoping you'll like it.

This implementation uses the paid [2Captcha](https://2captcha.com/about) service (a.k.a. ruCaptcha) to solve the hCaptcha challenges automatically and does not use any already made closed-source paid Suno API implementations.

## Demo

We have deployed an example bound to a free Suno account, so it has daily usage limits, but you can see how it runs:
[suno.gcui.ai](https://suno.gcui.ai)

## Features

- Perfectly implements the creation API from suno.ai.
- Automatically keep the account active.
- Solve CAPTCHAs automatically using [2Captcha](https://2captcha.com) and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) with [rebrowser-patches](https://github.com/rebrowser/rebrowser-patches).
- Compatible with the format of OpenAI's `/v1/chat/completions` API.
- Supports Custom Mode.
- One-click deployment to [Vercel](#deploy-to-vercel) & [Docker](#docker).
- In addition to the standard API, it also adapts to the API Schema of Agent platforms like GPTs and Coze, so you can use it as a tool/plugin/Action for LLMs and integrate it into any AI Agent.
- Permissive open-source license, allowing you to freely integrate and modify.

## Getting Started

### 1. Obtain the cookie of your Suno account

1. Head over to [suno.com/create](https://suno.com/create) using your browser.
2. Open up the browser console: hit `F12` or access the `Developer Tools`.
3. Navigate to the `Network` tab.
4. Give the page a quick refresh.
5. Identify the latest request that includes the keyword `?__clerk_api_version`.
6. Click on it and switch over to the `Header` tab.
7. Locate the `Cookie` section, hover your mouse over it, and copy the value of the Cookie.

![get cookie](https://github.com/gcui-art/suno-api/blob/main/public/get-cookie-demo.gif)

### 2. Register on 2Captcha and top up your balance
[2Captcha](https://2captcha.com/about) is a paid CAPTCHA solving service that uses real workers to solve the CAPTCHA and has high accuracy. It is needed because of Suno constantly requesting hCaptcha solving that currently isn't possible for free by any means.

[Create](https://2captcha.com/auth/register?userType=customer) a new 2Captcha account, [top up](https://2captcha.com/pay) your balance and [get your API key](https://2captcha.com/enterpage#recognition).

> [!NOTE]
> If you are located in Russia or Belarus, use the [ruCaptcha](https://rucaptcha.com) interface instead of 2Captcha. It's the same service, but it supports payments from those countries.

> [!TIP]
> If you want as few CAPTCHAs as possible, it is recommended to use a macOS system. macOS systems usually get fewer CAPTCHAs than Linux and Windows‚Äîthis is due to its unpopularity in the web scraping industry. Running suno-api on Windows and Linux will work, but in some cases, you could get a pretty large number of CAPTCHAs.

### 3. Clone and deploy this project

You can choose your preferred deployment method:

#### Deploy to Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fgcui-art%2Fsuno-api&env=SUNO_COOKIE,TWOCAPTCHA_KEY,BROWSER,BROWSER_GHOST_CURSOR,BROWSER_LOCALE,BROWSER_HEADLESS&project-name=suno-api&repository-name=suno-api)

#### Run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gcui-art/suno-api.git
cd suno-api
npm install
```
#### Docker
>[!IMPORTANT]
> GPU acceleration will be disabled in Docker. If you have a slow CPU, it is recommended to [deploy locally](#run-locally).

Alternatively, you can use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). However, follow the step below before running.

```bash
docker compose build && docker compose up
```

### 4. Configure suno-api

- If deployed to Vercel, please add the environment variables in the Vercel dashboard.

- If you're running this locally, be sure to add the following to your `.env` file:
#### Environment variables
- `SUNO_COOKIE` ‚Äî the `Cookie` header you obtained in the first step.
- `TWOCAPTCHA_KEY` ‚Äî your 2Captcha API key from the second step.
- `BROWSER` ‚Äî the name of the browser that is going to be used to solve the CAPTCHA. Only `chromium` and `firefox` supported.
- `BROWSER_GHOST_CURSOR` ‚Äî use ghost-cursor-playwright to simulate smooth mouse movements. Please note that it doesn't seem to make any difference in the rate of CAPTCHAs, so you can set it to `false`. Retained for future testing.
- `BROWSER_LOCALE` ‚Äî the language of the browser. Using either `en` or `ru` is recommended, since those have the most workers on 2Captcha. [List of supported languages](https://2captcha.com/2captcha-api#language)
- `BROWSER_HEADLESS` ‚Äî run the browser without the window. You probably want to set this to `true`.
- `BROWSER_USER_AGENT` ‚Äî Optional, it defaults to a Mac OS user agent for better captcha solving times
```bash
SUNO_COOKIE=<‚Ä¶>
TWOCAPTCHA_KEY=<‚Ä¶>
BROWSER=chromium
BROWSER_GHOST_CURSOR=false
BROWSER_LOCALE=en
BROWSER_HEADLESS=true
BROWSER_USER_AGENT=
```

### 4.1 Install Browser Dependencies

Since this project uses browser automation for CAPTCHA solving, you need to install the required browser:

```bash
# Install the required browser binary
npx rebrowser-playwright-core install chromium
```

This will download and install the Chromium browser that's compatible with the automation system.

### 4.2 Setting the Vercel Function Timeout in the deployment settings

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is only required for Vercel deployments. If you are running this project locally, you can skip this step.

Since this project uses browser automation for CAPTCHA solving, you need to set the Vercel Function Timeout to 300 seconds (for PRO users) or 60 seconds (for FREE users).

```bash
# Go to the Vercel dashboard
# Click on the "Settings" tab
# Scroll down to the "Functions" section
# Set the "Timeout" to 300(PRO) or 60(FREE) seconds
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using the free plan, the CAPTCHA will rarely solve before 1 minute.

### 5. Run suno-api

- If you've deployed to Vercel:
  - Please click on Deploy in the Vercel dashboard and wait for the deployment to be successful.
  - Visit the `https://<vercel-assigned-domain>/api/get_limit` API for testing.
- If running locally:
  - Run `npm run dev`.
  - Visit the `http://localhost:3000/api/get_limit` API for testing.
- If the following result is returned:

```json
{
  "credits_left": 50,
  "period": "day",
  "monthly_limit": 50,
  "monthly_usage": 50
}
```

it means the program is running normally.

### 6. Use Suno API

You can check out the detailed API documentation at :
[suno.gcui.ai/docs](https://suno.gcui.ai/docs)

## API Reference

Suno API currently mainly implements the following APIs:

```bash
- `/api/generate`: Generate music
- `/v1/chat/completions`: Generate music - Call the generate API in a format that works with OpenAI's API.
- `/api/custom_generate`: Generate music (Custom Mode, support setting lyrics, music style, title, etc.)
- `/api/generate_lyrics`: Generate lyrics based on prompt
- `/api/get`: Get music information based on the id. Use "," to separate multiple ids.
    If no IDs are provided, all music will be returned.
- `/api/get_limit`: Get quota Info
- `/api/extend_audio`: Extend audio length
- `/api/generate_stems`: Make stem tracks (separate audio and music track)
- `/api/get_aligned_lyrics`: Get list of timestamps for each word in the lyrics
- `/api/clip`: Get clip information based on ID passed as query parameter `id`
- `/api/concat`: Generate the whole song from extensions
```

You can also specify the cookies in the `Cookie` header of your request, overriding the default cookies in the `SUNO_COOKIE` environment variable. This comes in handy when, for example, you want to use multiple free accounts at the same time.
